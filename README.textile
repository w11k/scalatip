h1. ScalaTip

"ScalaTip":http://scalatip.org/ is a web application collecting, persisting and showing tweets containing "#Scala Tip of the Day". It is also a simple demo for lots of awesome Scala libraries like "Akka":http://akka.io/, "Lift":http://liftweb.net/, "Casbah":http://api.mongodb.org/scala/casbah/ (for MongoDB), etc. playing nicely together.
